summary: A simplified single host configuration
description: >
  This simple example creates a single public Amazon Linux instance on EC2 using
  CloudFormation, bootstraps Puppet, and performs a few minor configuration
  actions.  It relies only minimally on Jinja2 templating, so that all of the
  CloudFormation configuration is clear and easily modifiable.
