nepho-openshift
===============

This is a cloudlet for [nepho](http://github.com/huit/nepho) that deploys OpenShift Origin on Fedora 19.  There are both all-in-one and full-stack implementations for AWS.

Currently I'm using a private pre-bootstrapped Fedora 19 AMI, but you can sub-in a generic AMI instead and the bootstrap script will do it's thing, it will just take a bit longer.

The all-in-one implementation is in-progress and full-stack is nowhere yet.
